# Mentra - AI & Human Mentorship Platform

## Overview

Mentra is a comprehensive mentorship platform that combines AI-powered conversations with human mentor sessions. The platform serves organizational communities (churches, businesses, cities) by offering both instant AI guidance and scheduled human mentorship through a sophisticated semantic personality system.

**Core Vision:** "Sometimes you need one man who's lived it. Sometimes you need a council who's seen it all."

The platform has evolved beyond traditional subscription tiers to provide universal access to AI mentors, individual human mentorship, and council sessions (group mentoring with 3-5 mentors).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui design system
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Authentication**: Clerk enterprise authentication with social login

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Vercel serverless functions (migrated from Express.js)
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Clerk enterprise authentication with JWT tokens and user sync
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for mentor conversations
- **Real-time Communication**: HTTP polling with optimistic UI updates

## Key Components

### Enterprise Authentication System (Clerk)
The platform uses Clerk for complete authentication management:

- **Identity Management**: Clerk handles user registration, login, password resets, and email verification
- **Social Authentication**: Support for Google, Facebook, Apple, and other OAuth providers  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Built-in MFA support for enhanced security
- **JWT Token System**: Secure session management with automatic token refresh
- **User Sync**: Automatic synchronization between Clerk identity and application database
- **Clerk ID Mapping**: Each user has a unique clerkUserId field for secure lookups
- **Migration Support**: Existing users can link accounts via email fallback during sync
- **Development Fallback**: Conditional authentication provider for development environments

### Semantic AI Mentor System
The platform features an advanced semantic personality layer for AI mentors:

- **Personality Configuration**: Each AI mentor has detailed semantic configuration including communication style, core values, decision-making patterns, and mentoring approach
- **Life Stories Database**: Rich collection of personal stories (25+ for David mentor) with emotional context matching
- **Story Selection Algorithm**: Context-aware selection of 3-5 relevant stories based on user input
- **Response Audit System**: Automatic quality checking and regeneration to avoid generic responses
- **Custom Prompt System**: Porch-style conversation approach emphasizing humanity and authentic connection

### Human Mentor Management
- **Mentor Profiles**: Comprehensive profiles with ratings, availability, and expertise areas
- **Dual Scheduling Systems**: Native calendar integration plus Calendly fallback
- **Session Types**: 30-minute individual sessions and 60-minute council sessions
- **Automated Booking**: Instant confirmation with calendar invite generation
- **Council Coordination**: Intelligent availability matching for multi-mentor sessions

### Database Schema
Core entities include:
- **Users**: Authentication, subscription tracking, and usage limits
- **Organizations**: Multi-tenant support for churches, businesses, and cities
- **AI Mentors**: Configurable personalities with semantic layers
- **Human Mentors**: Professional mentor profiles and availability
- **Chat Messages**: Conversation history with context preservation
- **Mentoring Sessions**: Scheduled individual and council sessions

### Subscription & Access Model
Originally designed with three tiers, now simplified to universal access:
- **AI Mentors**: Unlimited access to semantic AI personalities
- **Individual Sessions**: Book 30-minute sessions with human mentors
- **Council Sessions**: Group sessions with 3-5 mentors for complex decisions

## Data Flow

2. Clerk handles authentication (email/password, social login, MFA)
3. Clerk issues JWT token stored in secure session cookies
4. Frontend automatically syncs Clerk user with backend database
5. API endpoints validate Clerk tokens and retrieve user context
6. User data flows seamlessly between Clerk identity and application data

### AI Mentor Conversations
1. User sends message via React frontend with Clerk session
2. TanStack Query handles optimistic updates with authentication
3. Vercel API route validates Clerk token and processes message
4. Story selection algorithm chooses relevant personal stories
5. Custom prompt combines user context with mentor personality
6. Anthropic Claude generates response with audit system
7. Response delivered via HTTP with real-time UI updates

### Human Mentor Booking
1. User selects mentor and available time slot
2. React Hook Form validates booking data with Clerk session
3. Vercel API route authenticates user and checks monthly limits
4. Database transaction creates session and updates usage
5. Calendar invites generated automatically
6. TanStack Query invalidates cache for instant UI refresh

### Council Session Coordination

## Deployment Strategy

### Vercel Serverless Architecture
The application has been refactored from Express.js to Vercel's serverless model:

- **Shared Libraries**: Common utilities in `/api/_lib` for database, auth, and storage
- **Static Frontend**: Vite-built React app served from Vercel's CDN
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration for database and API keys

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Direct, no-nonsense communication. Focus on real functionality over workarounds.

**Code Quality Standards:**
- Human mentors should always be arrays: Use `const { data } = useQuery(...); const humanMentors = Array.isArray(data?.data) ? data.data : [];` pattern consistently
- Do NOT repeat the same array safety pattern fixes multiple times - this has been implemented across all files already
- Focus on new functionality rather than re-implementing existing patterns
